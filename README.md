# Assignment details: CPME-252-Project
This is a group assignment, where you will be part of a team of 3 and create an AI application.  

### Forming a Team

Please form a team of 3 students and add the names of all team members under "Project Teams" on Canvas by January 14.  If you do not have a team by that time, I will assign you to a team.  

### AI Application

The AI application we will be working on this semester is a Virtual Assistant (chatbot).  You need to identify an application for your Virtual Assistant, e.g., helping someone with an IT issue, helping someone with issues related on online shopping, controlling devices in someone's home (e.g., lights, temperature, etc.).

### Minimum Functionality of your Virtual Assistant

Your Virtual Assistant should have the following capabilities at a minimum:

Ability to understand 20 user utterances/queries (including reasonable variations of those queries).
Ability to have at least 2 multi-turn conversations where the user may ask follow up questions.
Ability to collect data from the user, e.g., on what date did the issue occur, how many items did you have in your order, etc.
Ability to engage in some amount of small talk

### Conversational AI Platform


You can use a platform of your choice to build your chatbot.  Example platforms you can use are:


Chatterbot (Links to an external site.)
RASA (Links to an external site.)
Google Dialogflow (Links to an external site.) (1-year free subscription is usually available)
You are welcome to use other platforms.  Please run your choice by the course instructor first.


### Deliverables


#### Presentation on March 11, 2020 in class
5 minutes per person (max 15 minutes total per team) + 5 minutes of Q&A
You need to cover at least the following:
Motivation for your choice of application
Demo
Technical details of your implementation approach and architecture
Challenges you encountered
